#### Hi!

I'm Jeremy Lenz, NYC-based full stack web developer.

I have experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React.  Also a bit of Liquid (Shopify/Jekyll).  

If you're local I'm happy to meet in person!  

Educational background: jazz piano.  Passion for getting it right and doing work I can be proud of.
